            <p>
                I am a former teacher, expanding my skills and experience to make an exciting career change. I have resently graduated from a 12 week full stack boot camp at the University of Minnesota. Over those 12 weeks I learned front-end languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Bootstraps and I learned back-end languages  where I learned Node.js, Express, MySQL, NoSQL, Object Oriented Programing and I worked with API's. While I enjoy doing full stack development I took a special interest in databases on the backend.

                I have spent much of my professional career collaborating with my peers to develop resources that streamline and enhance learning, as well as using my creativity and problem solving skills to engage and benifit those around me and are things that I believe will benifit my future employeer and co-workers. My goal is to be a full-stack devloper, as well as market my skills for non-profits
                and small buisnesses. I am someone who works hard, sets goals, and pursues them to the best of my
                abilitiy.
